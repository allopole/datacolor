Description: This package provides prebuilt color palettes and functions for defining color palettes
    that are appropriate for data representation.  Color palettes for data should ideally be 
    perceptually linear in all perceptual color dimensions (hue, chroma or saturation, lightness or 
    luminance). Additional requirmeents for color scales can include the presence or absence 
    of discontinuities and corners, maximizing discrimination between levels, and being 
    color-blind safe.  This package relies in part on the perceptually flat colorspace HCL.
