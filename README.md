# datacolor

Color Scales for Data Visualization

This package provides prebuilt color palettes and functions for defining
color palettes that are appropriate for data representation. Color
palettes for data should ideally be perceptually linear in all
perceptual color dimensions (hue, chroma or saturation, lightness or
luminance). Additional requirmeents for color scales can include the
presence or absence of discontinuities and corners, maximizing
discrimination between levels, and being color-blind safe. This package
relies in part on the perceptually flat colorspace HCL.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("allopole/datacolor")
```

## Example
